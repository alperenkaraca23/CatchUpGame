# CatchUpGame

<li> For this game that I designed with storyboard, I first integrated 9 images and activated their userinteraction feature. </li>
<li> Then I defined gesture recognizer </li>
<li> After making all the photos invisible, I generated random numbers and made the photo corresponding to that number appear. Thus, I made the photo appear to be moving. </li>
<li> I ensured that the score increased with each successful click. </li>
<li> Finally, I added the feature of keeping the highest score and replay with a warning after the timer is done. </li>
